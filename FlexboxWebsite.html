                    he Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.

                <p>
                    Some of the advantages of flexbox are: page content can be laid out in any direction (to the left, to the right, downwards or even upwards) bits of content can have their visual order reversed or rearranged.

                        <p>
                            Flexbox is a CSS3 layout model that solves usually tricky problems including how to position, center or dynamically resize elements on a page. It's a tool modern enough to create responsive designs and old enough to be implemented in major browsers.

                                    <p>
                                        A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based).
